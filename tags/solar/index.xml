      <description>Vedauwoo Overlook We found this spot on Campendium here: https://www.campendium.com/pole-mountain-area
Coming out Monday morning, we saw that quite a few of the spots were occupied. I hopped on the bike and went for a little ride to scout camps and was able to find one within easy reach of the Pudu.
The camp is at the top of the hill on the side of a meadow with a cool rock outcropping and lots of nice sites around.</description>
