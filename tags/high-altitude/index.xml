      <description>Beartooth Getaway This campsite was a high altitude stunner. We were up around 8600 ft or so above sea level in an alpine tundra. The main reason we came all the way up here was that the temperatures below were extremely hot. We&amp;rsquo;re talking above 95F as we were coming up the Beartooth Highway. Finally things cooled off a bit up here, though not by much. We still were having 85F daytime temps even at this altitude.</description>
