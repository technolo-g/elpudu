      <description>Burning Field This camp is in Hiawatha National Forest outside of Rapid River, MI. It&amp;rsquo;s right off of the main road and we camped only a short distance in on the forest service road. This lead to a bit of traffic, but really only like 5 people total. It made for an easy spot on our way from Denver to NH.
The spot we were at had very little signal (like 2 bars of 4g) that we were able to improve to about 20/10mbit service with the booster.</description>
