      <description>Vedauwoo Overlook We found this spot on Campendium here: https://www.campendium.com/pole-mountain-area
Coming out Monday morning, we saw that quite a few of the spots were occupied. I hopped on the bike and went for a little ride to scout camps and was able to find one within easy reach of the Pudu.
The camp is at the top of the hill on the side of a meadow with a cool rock outcropping and lots of nice sites around.</description>

      <description>Burning Field This camp is in Hiawatha National Forest outside of Rapid River, MI. It&amp;rsquo;s right off of the main road and we camped only a short distance in on the forest service road. This lead to a bit of traffic, but really only like 5 people total. It made for an easy spot on our way from Denver to NH.
The spot we were at had very little signal (like 2 bars of 4g) that we were able to improve to about 20/10mbit service with the booster.</description>
