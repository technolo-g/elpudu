# Burning Field
This camp is in Hiawatha National Forest outside of Rapid River, MI. It's right off of the
main road and we camped only a short distance in on the forest service road. This lead to a
bit of traffic, but really only like 5 people total. It made for an easy spot on our way from
Denver to NH. 

The spot we were at had very little signal (like 2 bars of 4g) that we were able to improve
to about 20/10mbit service with the booster. At first we had it pointed at a 4g tower, but
when we found other antennas on antennasearch.com and tried those, it turned out to be great
LTE service. This plus the generator made it a nice easy work day. 

We met some neighbors who recommended a NF campground down the street (I think it was Little
Bay de Noc campground: https://goo.gl/maps/REi19JmL8LA2 but can't be sure). They said it's 
very beautiful, only like $10, and they have spots right on the lake. We will try this next
time through.
