# Mt. Shavano BLM

## Overview
This was a very pretty BLM area outside of Salida. It's super close to
both Hecla and Stonebridge and only about 10-15 minutes to Walmart. This
was our first boondocking adventure and so we wanted to be close to town
as well as close to rafting. 

## Good
We stayed at the end of a cul-de-sac overlooking the mountains towards 
Gunnison. We had a ton of privacy and beautiful views and we were able to
burn before Memorial Day Weekend; after which, there was a fire ban.

## Bad
There were a lot of logging trucks coming and going during the weekdays and
even on Saturday. Over Memorial Day Weekend it got pretty busy, but nobody was
really louder than us. The wind was cranking pretty much all day, every day.
It became annoying at the end.

## Ugly
The site had a lot of trash in it, including what seem to be poop buckets,
a mattress, kitty litter, an automobile seat, and a bunch of other random 
trash around. 

## Events of note
The hot water heater in El Pud√∫ crapped out the day we arrived. That was a
bummer and we camped the whole time using the JetBoil.
