# Camp Slanty (Site #A30)

This is a pretty nice campground outside of Estes Park that we reserved on Reserve America
because it is only 55 minutes from the office. We pulled in, black full and half a fresh to
a fully packed campground just outside the entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park. The road
was certainly narrow and as Tiffany and I were parking it around the 70 degree bend in front
of our site, the transmission temperature light came on. I shifted to 4lo and from now on wil
be using that gear for pulling into camp.

There was 'no signal' at the campground and even with the booster, we could not get a workable
connection so I worked from town most days. On the last day while hiking up east portal trail,
I found some good service about a 10 minute hike up the hill. Also on this hike (it was Workday
Boulder's mountain day), I saw 3 deer in the forest and got to chill with them. It was very nice.
