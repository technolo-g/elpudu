      <description>Mt. Shavano BLM Overview This was a very pretty BLM area outside of Salida. It&amp;rsquo;s super close to both Hecla and Stonebridge and only about 10-15 minutes to Walmart. This was our first boondocking adventure and so we wanted to be close to town as well as close to rafting.
Good We stayed at the end of a cul-de-sac overlooking the mountains towards Gunnison. We had a ton of privacy and beautiful views and we were able to burn before Memorial Day Weekend; after which, there was a fire ban.</description>
